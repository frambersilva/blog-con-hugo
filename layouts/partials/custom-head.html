<!-- Custom Head Content -->
<!-- 
  This partial is intentionally left empty in the theme.
  Users can override this partial in their own site by creating:
  layouts/partials/custom-head.html
  
  Example usage - Add any custom code to the <head> section:
  
  - Custom tracking scripts (Hotjar, Mixpanel, etc.)
  - Meta tags for verification (Google Search Console, Pinterest, etc.)
  - Custom CSS or JavaScript libraries
  - Any other HTML that should be in the <head>
  
  Example:
  <script>
    // Your custom tracking code
  </script>
-->
